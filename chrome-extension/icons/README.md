# Icon Placeholder Files

For the Chrome extension to work properly, you need to add icon files in the following sizes:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should represent your HirePilot brand and be easily recognizable.

## Recommended Icon Design:

- Use your HirePilot logo
- Ensure good contrast and visibility at small sizes
- Consider using a simplified version for smaller sizes
- Use PNG format with transparency

## Creating Icons:

1. Design a 128x128 pixel icon first
2. Create smaller versions by scaling down
3. Optimize for clarity at each size
4. Test how they look in the Chrome toolbar

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple ones with initials "HP" for HirePilot.
